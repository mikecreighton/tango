# Tango TODOs

- [ ] Come up with a list of different hotkeys needed for fluid work flows
  - [ ] Eye dropper (Alt / Cmd)
  - [ ] Show color picker
  - [ ] Brush hotkeys... probably numbers
  - [ ] Need to come up with more...
- [ ] Show / hide coolor picker (possibly with [p5.js's `createColorPicker`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/createColorPicker))
- [ ] Change canvas color
- [ ] Come up with brush ideas
- [ ] Integrate some color logic with [toxiclibs.js](https://github.com/hapticdata/toxiclibsjs). (Yes, I'd rather use [thi.ng](https://thi.ng), but that gets me into that tooling rathole I'm trying to avoid. And I'm already familiar with toxiclibs from Processing.)
- [ ] Design an abstract brush interface
    - [ ] Figure out an "update" or "draw" interface that's common to all "brushes".

# What I'm Not Going TODO

- Emulate traditional brushes
- Create undo functionality
-
